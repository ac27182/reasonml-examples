# reasonml-todo

## notes

- my styling is complete garbage

- really enjoy utilising functional features like variant types and pattern matching for building user intefaces

- gained a good degree of confidence writing react components using reasonreact

- took a bit of getting used to some of the compiler quirks (always keep an eye out for semicolons)

- love the reverse application operator to combine function calls

## future improvements

- better, minimal styling

- utilise the bucklescript binding for the uuid

- better nomenclature for the reducer actions

- making the dispatch functions more generic, they all pretty much
  do the same thing

- perhaps make use of relude, to give the functions a higher degree of referential transparency.

- making components more loosely coupled...

- actually write some unit tests
